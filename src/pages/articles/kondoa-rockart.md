The Kondoa Irangi Rock Paintings are a series of ancient paintings on rock shelter walls in central Tanzania. They are located approximately nine kilometres east of the main highway (T5) from Dodoma to Babati, about 20 km north of Kondoa town, in Kondoa District of Dodoma Region, Tanzania. Some of the paintings are believed by the Tanzania Antiquities Department to date back more than 50,000 years. The exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area is currently uncertain. However, estimates for the number of decorated rock shelters in the region range between 150 and 450. The paintings depict elongated people, animals, and hunting scenes. Tourists are asked to report to the Antiquities Department office on the highway at the village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolo_(Tanzanian_ward)">Kolo</a> and ask for the cave paintings guide or call 0687944506.
