The Kingdom of Zulu , sometimes referred to as the Zulu Empire or the Kingdom of Zululand, was a monarchy in Southern Africa that extended along the coast of the Indian Ocean from the Tugela River in the south to Pongola River in the north.

        <li>
The kingdom grew to dominate much of what is today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a> and Southern Africa.

Shaka kaSenzangakhona (c. 1787 â€“ 1828), also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka">Shaka</a> Zulu (also spelled Tshaka or Chaka), was one of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu Kingdom. Shaka initiated many military, social, cultural and political reforms, forming a well-organized and centralised Zulu state. The most important reforms involved the transformation of the army, through the innovative tactics and weapons he conceived, and a showdown with the spiritual leadership, witchdoctors, effectively ensuring the subservience of the "Zulu church" to the state.

Another important reform integrated defeated clans into the Zulu, on a basis of full equality, with promotions in the army and civil service becoming a matter of merit rather than due to circumstances of birth.

In 1879, the British Empire invaded, beginning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zulu_War">Anglo-Zulu War</a>. After an initial Zulu victory at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana">Battle of Isandlwana</a> in January, the British Army would regroup and eventually defeated the Zulus in July in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ulundi">Battle of Ulundi</a>. The area was subsequently absorbed into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Natal">Colony of Natal</a> and later became part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa">Union of South Africa</a>.
