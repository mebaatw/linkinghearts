One finds well-laid-out streets and fortified compounds, all made out of skilled stone masonry. In all, there were 500 settlements.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nThe faunal evidence at the Dhar Tichitt area is highly diverse. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the most common faunal remains. Other faunal remains include crocodile, hippopotamus, ostrich, gazelle, fish, and very few representative bones of other animals. Given the amount of faunal remains that are from domesticated animals it is safe to say that this was a pastoralist society. \n        </li>\n        <li>\nIn addition to herding livestock, its inhabitants fished and grew millet. The botanical remains at the site reveal that the pastoralists society practiced some cultivation. Pennisetum or bulrush millet is the only domesticate found at this site, and was most commonly cultivated during the rainy season at upland settlements. During the dry season, wild grains and fruits were collected in the lowlands to supplement the otherwise pastoralist diet.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nThe Dhar Tichitt site had become a complex culture by 3600 BP and had architectural and material culture elements that seemed to match the site at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koumbi_Saleh\">Koumbi Saleh</a>.
