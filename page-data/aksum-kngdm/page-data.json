At its height the empire extended across most of present-day Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, Sudan, Egypt, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism\">Manichaei prophet Mani</a> regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time, the others being Persia, Rome, and China.\n</li>\n<li> The kingdom had it's own writing system called\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script\"> Ge'ez</a>\n</li>\n<li>\nThe Aksumite polity  grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Aksum\">Book of Aksum</a>, Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush. The capital was later moved to the city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum\">Axum</a> in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name \"Ethiopia\" as early as the fourth century.\n</li>\n<li>\nAksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite currency. From the reign of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endubis\">Endubis</a> (c. 270 – c. 300)  up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armah\">Armah</a> (c. 270 - 610), gold, silver and bronze coins were minted.\n</li>\n<li >\nThe Aksumites had cemeteries with elaborate grave stones called stelee or obelisks, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet.\n</li>\n<li>\nUnder <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum\">Ezana</a> (fl. 320–360) Aksum adopted Christianity in place of its former polytheistic and Judaic religions around 325.\n<br/><br/>\nEthiopian sources such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebra_Nagast\">Kebra Nagast</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetha_Nagast\">Fetha Nagast</a> describe Aksum as a Jewish Kingdom. The Kebra Nagast contains a narrative of how the Queen of Sheba/Queen Makeda of Ethiopia met King Solomon and traces Ethiopia's to Menelik I, her son by King Solomon of Israel. In its existing form the Kebra Nagast is at least 700 years old and is considered by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church\">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> to be a reliable and historic work.\n<br/><br/>\nTradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Sheba\">Queen of Sheba</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\nAround 330 AD, Ezana of Axum led his army into the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush\">Kingdom of Meroë</a>, conquering and sacking the town itself. A large stone monument was left there, and the conquest is also related on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezana_Stone\">Ezana Stone</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\nAround 520, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleb_of_Axum\">King Kaleb</a> sent an expedition to Yemen against the Jewish <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himyarite_Kingdom\">Himyarite</a> king Dhu Nuwas, who was persecuting the Christian community there. For nearly half a century south Arabia would become an Ethiopian protectorate under Abraha and his son Masruq.\n</li>\n<li>\nIn the late sixth century, Sasanian Empire of Persia and the Ethiopia-based Aksumite Empire fought a series of wars over control of the Himyarite Kingdom in Yemen, Southern Arabia known as the <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksumite%E2%80%93Persian_wars\">Aksumite–Persian wars</a>. It marked the end of Ethiopian rule in Arabia.\n</li>\n<li>\nIn the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra.\n</li>\n<li>\nAfter a second golden age in the early 6th century the empire began to decline in the mid 6th century, eventually ceasing its production of coins in the early 7th century. Around this same time, the Aksumite population was forced to go farther inland to the highlands for protection, abandoning Aksum as the capital.\n<br/><br/>\nLocal history holds that, around 960, a Jewish Queen named Yodit (Judith) or \"Gudit\" defeated the empire and burned its churches and literature. While there is evidence of churches being burned and an invasion around this time, her existence has been questioned by some modern authors. Another possibility is that the Aksumite power was ended by a southern pagan queen named Bani al-Hamwiyah, possibly of the tribe al-Damutah or Damoti (Sidama). It is clear from contemporary sources that a female usurper did indeed rule the country at this time, and that her reign ended some time before 1003.\n</li>\n</ul></ul>\nRead more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom<em>of</em>Aksum</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></p>","fields":{"slug":"aksum-kngdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Aksum","types":"Kingdoms,KEYS","headers":[],"img":[{"name":"aksum-kngdm_North_Stelae_Park.jpg","desc":"The largest Aksumite stele, broken where it fell."},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_Stelae_Park2.jpg","desc":"Tombs beneath the stele field."},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_Ousas.jpg","desc":"Aksumite gold coins."},{"name":"aksum-kngdm-Hijra_Abyssinia.jpg","desc":"14th century illustration showing the king of Aksum declining the request of a Meccan delegation to yield up the Muslims.
