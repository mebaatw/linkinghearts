The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in Fasil Ghebbi (the Royal Enclosure), for which Gondar has been called the \"Camelot of Africa\".</p>\n<p>Until the 16th century, the Solomonic Emperors of Ethiopia usually had no fixed capital town, but instead lived in tents in temporary royal camps as they moved around their realms while their family, bodyguard and retinue devoured surplus crops and cut down nearby trees for firewood. One exception to this rule was Debre Berhan, founded by Zara Yaqob in 1456; Tegulet in Shewa was also essentially the capital during the first century of Solomonic rule. Gondar was founded by Emperor Fasilides around the year 1635, and grew as an agricultural and market town. There was a superstition at the time that the capital's name should begin with the letter 'Gʷa' (modern pronunciation 'Gʷe'; Gonder was originally spelt Gʷandar), which also contributed to Gorgora's (founded as Gʷargʷara) growth in the centuries after 1600. Tradition also states that a buffalo led the Emperor Fasilides to a pool beside the Angereb, where an \"old and venerable hermit\" told the Emperor he would locate his capital there. Fasilides had the pool filled in and built his castle on that same site. The emperor also built a total of seven churches; the first two, Fit Mikael and Fit Abbo, were built to end local epidemics. The five emperors who followed him also built their palaces in the town.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondar\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondar</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"gondar"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gondar","types":"Ruins","headers":null,"img":[{"name":"gondar_Fasilides_Palace_02.jpg","desc":"Fasilides Castle, founded by Emperor Fasilides"},{"name":"gondar_City2.jpg","desc":"An overview of the medieval city buildings"},{"name":"gondar_Fasiladas_Bath_Timket.jpg","desc":"Crowds gather at the Fasilides' Bath in Gondar to celebrate Timkat – the Epiphany for the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church."},{"name":"gondar_of_Debra_Berhan_Selassie_01.jpg","desc":"Debre Birhan Selassie Church in Gondar"},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
