Its capital was the city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soba_(city)\">Soba</a>, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia\">Nobadia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria\">Makuria</a>. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Alodia was a large, multicultural state administrated by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n            In the mid-10th century, Alodia was visited by traveler and historian Ibn Hawqal, resulting in the most comprehensive known account of the kingdom. He described the geography and people of Alodia in considerable detail, giving the impression of a large, polyethnic state. He also noted its prosperity, having an \"uninterrupted chain of villages and a continuous strip of cultivated lands\".\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Monumental structures, have been unearthed in the capital Soba.  The discoveries include several churches, a palace, cemeteries and numerous small finds.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            State and church were intertwined in Alodia, with the Alodian kings probably serving as its patrons. Coptic documents observed by Johann Michael Vansleb during the later 17th century list the following bishoprics in the Alodian kingdom: Arodias, Borra, Gargara, Martin, Banazi, and Menkesa. Arodias might have referred to the bishopric in Soba. The bishops were dependent on the patriarch of Alexandria.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Alodia may have had a standing army, in which cavalry likely projected force and symbolized royal authority deep into the provinces. Because of their speed, horses were also important for communication, providing a rapid courier service between the capital and the provinces. Aside from horses, boats also played a central role in transportation infrastructure.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Fazughli\">Kingdom of Fazughli</a> within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.\n        </li>\n    </ul></ul>\n    </div>\nRead more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alodia","fields":{"slug":"alodia-kngdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Alodia","types":"Kingdoms,KEYS","headers":null,"img":[{"name":"alodia-kngdm-Soba_3_churches.gif","desc":"Church complex of \"Mound B\", Soba, including, from up to bottom: \"Church A\", \"Church B\" and \"Church C\""},{"name":"alodia-kngdm-Soba_capital.jpg","desc":"A capital from the \"Mound C\" church, Soba"},{"name":"alodia-kngdm-Marble_stone_with_southern-Nubian_inscription_Soba.jpg","desc":"Fragmentary marble stone from Soba with Nubian inscription"},{"name":"alodia-kngdm-King_Moses_George_of_Makuria.jpg","desc":"King Mouses Georgios, who probably ruled Makuria and Alodia simultaneously.

One of the most important discoveries from the Christian period was the town's cathedral. The cathedral had been completely filled with sand which preserved a large number of intricate paintings on its walls. These paintings are the best surviving examples of Christian Nubian art and depict portraits of various monarchs and bishops of Faras, Christian saints and a number of well-known Biblical scenes.

Founded in 1504 by the Funj, it quickly converted to Islam, although this embracement was only nominal. Until a more orthodox Islam took hold in the 18th century the state remained an \"African-Nubian empire with a Muslim facade\". It reached its peak in the late 17th century, but began to decline and eventually fall apart in the 18th.
