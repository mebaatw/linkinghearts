It is located in a large basin surrounded by low sandstone hills in the western Butana, 180 km northeast of Khartoum, 20 km north of Naqa and approximately 25 km south-east of the Nile. Its MGRS coordinates: 36QWD3477214671. With Meroë and Naqa it is known as the Island of Meroe, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011. Constructed in sandstone, the main features of the site include the Great Enclosure, the Lion Temple of Apedemak and the Great Reservoir. Most significant is the number of representations of elephants, suggesting that this animal played an important role at Musawwarat es-Sufra.</p>\n<p>The Lion Tenple is a single-chambered rectangular 14.21 m in length, 9.13 m in width and 4.7 m in height temple with pylon and six columns made of drums. Erected by King Arnekhamani and dedicated to Apedemak the temple beers inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphs and representations of elephants and lions on the rear inside wall as well as reliefs of Apedemak depicted as a three-headed god on the outside walls.</p>\n<p>The Great Enclosure is the main structure of the site. Much of the large labyrinth-like building complex, which covers approximately 45,000 m2, was erected in the third century BC. According to Hintze, \"the complicated ground plan of this extensive complex of buildings is without parallel in the entire Nile valley\". The maze of courtyards includes three (possible) temples, passages, low walls, preventing any contact with the outside world, about 20 columns, ramps and two reservoirs.</p>\n<p>There were many sculptures of animals, such as elephants and most of the walls of the complex bear graffiti and masons’ or pilgrims' marks both pictorial and in Meroitic or Greek script. The scheme of the site is, so far, without parallel in Nubia and ancient Egypt, and there is some debate about the purpose of the buildings, with earlier suggestions including a college, a hospital, and an elephant-training camp. According to the scholar Basil Davidson, at least four Kushite queens — Amanirenas, Amanishakheto, Nawidemak and Amanitore — probably spent part of their lives in Musawwarat es-Sufra.</p>\n<p>The Great Reservoir is a Hafir to retain as much as possible of the rainfall of the short, wet season. It is 250 m in diameter and excavated 6.3 m into the ground.</p>","fields":{"slug":"musawwarat"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Musawwarat","types":"Ruins","headers":null,"img":[{"name":"musawwarat_es-sufra_2018.jpg","desc":"Apedemak Lion Temple"},{"name":"musawwarat_LionTemple.jpg","desc":"Columns in the Lion Temple"},{"name":"musawwarat_es-sufra760.jpg","desc":"Relief of Apedemak"},{"name":"musawwarat_es-sufra10.jpg","desc":"View of the Great Enclosure"},{"name":"musawwarat_Piramidi_Khartoum-2.jpg","desc":"An entrance to the Great Enclosure"},{"name":"musawwarat_Meroe.jpg","desc":"Statue of an elephant"},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzfxTNTbqMM","title":"Sudan - Musawwarat-es-Sufra excavations"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LF0QnwbpBSE","title":"3D Flythrough of Musawwarat es Sufra"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SK7EiV9NSWw","title":"3D Walkthrough of Musawwarat es Sufra documented by the Zamani Project "},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lm31bmpKVfQ","title":"LION temple Musawwarat es Sufra"}],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanirenas","title":"Amanirenas","desc":"Amanirenas (also spelled Amanirena) was a queen of the Meroitic Kingdom of Kush.
