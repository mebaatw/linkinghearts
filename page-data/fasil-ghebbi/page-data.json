It was founded in the 17th century by Emperor Fasilides (Fasil) and was the home of Ethiopia's emperors. Its unique architecture shows diverse influences including Nubian styles. The site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Ghebbi is an Amharic word for a compound or enclosure.</p>\n<p>The complex of buildings includes Fasilides' castle, Iyasu I's palace, Dawit III's Hall, a banqueting hall, stables, Empress Mentewab's castle, a chancellery, library and three churches: Asasame Qeddus Mikael, Elfign Giyorgis and Gemjabet Mariyam.</p>\n<p>The origins of the Fasil Ghebbi can be found in the old tradition of the Ethiopian emperors to travel around their possessions, living off the produce of the peasants and dwelling in tents. Reflecting this connection, this precinct was frequently referred to as a katama (\"camp\" or \"fortified settlement\") or makkababya, the name applied to the imperial camp in the Royal Chronicle of Baeda Maryam.</p>\n<p>Emperor Fasilides broke with this tradition of progressing through the territories, and founded the city of Gondar as his capital; its relative permanence makes the city historically important. Within the capital, he commanded the construction of an imposing edifice, the Fasil Gemb or Fasilides castle. The area around the Fasil Gemb was delineated by a wall with numerous gates. Subsequent emperors built their own structures, many of which survive either in whole or part today. Visiting the Fasil Ghebbi in the late 1950s, Thomas Pakenham observed that \"dotted among the palaces are what remains of the pavilions and kiosks of the imperial city\".</p>\n<p>Fasil Ghebbi covers an area of about 70,000 square meters. To its south lies Adababay, the market place of Gondar, where imperial proclamations were made, troops presented, and criminals executed; it is currently a city park.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasil_Ghebbi\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasil_Ghebbi</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"fasil-ghebbi"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fasil Ghebbi","types":"Ruins","headers":null,"img":[{"name":"fasil-ghebbi_side.jpg","desc":"Side entrance to Fasil Gemb"},{"name":"fasil-ghebbi_img11.jpg","desc":"Interior of Fasilides' Palace"},{"name":"fasil-ghebbi_iyasu.jpg","desc":"Palace of Iyasu I"},{"name":"fasil-ghebbi22.jpg","desc":"Royal library building"},{"name":"fasil-ghebbi33.jpg","desc":"Royal archive building"},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6nyhFeAgNM","title":"The Palaces and Castles of Gondar, Ethiopia"}],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
