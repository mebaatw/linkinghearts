The Nyero rock paintings are among the most important rock art in Uganda.</p>\n<p>Nyero rock paintings date to before 1250 CE. They were first documented in 1913 and later described by researchers as largely of geometric nature. This type of rock art is part of a homogeneous tradition often depicted in red pigment, spreading across east, central and parts of southern Africa, matching the distribution of the Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer culture. This art is generally attributed to Batwa (Twa) hunter-gatherers who are of Pygmy origin, and are today, in Eastern Africa, only found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border and eastern Congo. It is likely that Twa hunter-gatherer communities once lived in the general area of these rock art sites, probably moving on due to the arrival of the present inhabitants (Nilotic, Luo, and Bantu groups). The paintings enrich the cultural identity of the people of Iteso, Uganda, and Africa as a whole.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyero_rock_paintings\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyero<em>rock</em>paintings</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"nyero-rockart"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nyero Rock Paintings","types":"Rock Art","headers":[{"id":1,"name":"Early Period"},{"id":2,"name":"Kerma"},{"id":3,"name":"Kush and Napata"},{"id":4,"name":"MeroÃ«"},{"id":5,"name":"Christian Nubia"},{"id":6,"name":"Islamic Nubia"},{"id":100,"name":"Gallery"},{"id":101,"name":"Documentary"},{"id":102,"name":"External Links"},{"id":103,"name":"References"}],"img":[{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x62C27AIKgI","title":"NYERO ROCK ART"}],"url":[],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
