The hills around the town are terraced with thousands of stone walls which form part of a vast complex of settlements, fields and roads. Some tour guides describe these as South Africa's \"real\" lost city.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists and historians have described the ruins as settlements of the baKoni people. Oral records and historical evidence trace the baKoni to at least the early 18th century. The ongoing 500 Year Initiative to rewrite South Africa's history continues to deliver new insights into the extent and complexity of these settlements. An international group of researchers have placed the baKoni settlements in the context of numerous other cases of agricultural intensification, that took place in the precolonial era in different parts of Africa.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3 id=1> Blaauboschkraal Stone Ruins</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Blaauboschkraal stone ruins, also known as Adam's Calendar are a provincial heritage site in Waterval Boven in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa.
