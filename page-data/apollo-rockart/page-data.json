The slabs found in the cave are referred to as the Apollo 11 Stones. In total, seven grey-brown quartzite slabs were excavated from the cave. Besides the slabs, the cave contained several white and red paintings. The subject of paintings ranged from simple geometric patterns to bees, which are still a nuisance to the unwary traveler.</p>\n<p>Art was also found near the cave in the form of engravings, on the banks of a riverbed, and on a large limestone boulder located 150 m (490 ft) from the cave. The engravings consisted of depictions of animals as well as simple geometric patterns. It is hard to pin point dates of the engravings and paintings, but the paintings may belong to period as far back as 10,400 BP and the engravings may come from early settlers in the first millennium AD. These dates come from Wendt’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy\">stratigraphic record</a> of the site as well as evidence from other sites in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p>More recent finds include two rib pieces (one with 26 notches; the other with 12 notches) dated to 80,000 BP.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_Cave\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo<em>11</em>Cave</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"apollo-rockart"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Apollo 11 Cave","types":"Rock Art","headers":[{"id":1,"name":"Early Period"}],"img":[{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLLH5YMZQPY","title":"AP Art History Study Apollo 11 Stones"}],"url":[],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
