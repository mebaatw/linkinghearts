Unfortunately, the Group's settlements cannot be traced in precision because of two reasons. First, their houses were built of perishable materials, such as unbaked-mud. Second, the Group's settlements were established very close to the Nile river where seasonal floods would have destroyed them long time ago. Therefore, most of what we know about the A-Group culture comes from the cemeteries located few miles away from the Nile Valley.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The material culture uncovered from the burials suggests a complex culture with a hierarchical structure. Excavations in cemeteries, in Sudan's northern border area, provided a good insight on the social complexity of the Group. The sizes of the graves there indicate the social status of the deceased. The larger the grave the richer was the deceased, and the smaller the poorer was the deceased.\n<sup>[2]</sup></span></span></p>\n<p>The A-Group culture represents the earliest known phase of state formation and Kingship on the Nile. Excavations at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qustul\">Qustul</a> (Lower Nubia) have indicated that the Nubians may have founded the earliest Monarchy in the Nile Valley, dated between 3800 BC to 3400 BC, older than the Scorpion King who was the earliest known Egyptian ruler. <sup>[1]</sup> The artifacts were discovered by Keith C. Seele, a professor at the University of Chicago. Of particular intrest was a an incense burner, which was adorned with Ancient Egyptian royal iconography <sup>[1]</sup>:<br/></p>\n<p><span><span><span>\nOn the incense burner, which was broken and had to be pieced together, was a depiction of a palace facade, a crowned king sitting on a throne in a boat, a royal standard before the king and, hovering above the king, the falcon god Horus. Most of the images are ones commonly associated with kingship in later Egyptian traditions.\n</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\nThe portion of the incense burner bearing the body of the king is missing but, Dr. Williams said, scholars are agreed that the presence of the crown — in a form well known from dynastic Egypt — and the god Horns are irrefutable evidence that the complete image was that of a king.’</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The majestic figure on the incense burner, Dr. Williams said, is the earliest known representation ‘of a king in the Nile Valley. His name is unknown, but he is believed to have lived approximately three generations of kings before the time of Scorpion, the earliest known Egyptian ruler. Scorpion was one of three kings said to have ruled Egypt before the start of what is called the first dynasty around 3050 B.C. <sup>[1]</sup>\n</span></span></p>\n<p>Although the incense burner was adorned with Ancient Egyptian royal iconography, it's design was distinctively Nubian:</p>\n<p><span><span><span>This incense burner is distinctively Nubian in form. Carved in the technique of Nubian rock art, it is decorated on the rim with typical Nubian designs. It was found in the tomb of a Nubian ruler at Qustul and incorporates images associated with Egyptian pharaohs: a procession of sacred boats, the White Crown of Upper Egypt, a falcon deity, and the palace facade called a serekh. It appears to represent a ritual that involved a royal procession by boat to a palace.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The scenes depicted on the Qustul Incense Burner have excited considerable interest and discussion - why would seemingly Egyptian symbols have been used in Nubia?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>One interpretation is that Nubian A-Group rulers and early Egyptian pharaohs used related royal symbols. Similarities in rock art of A-Group Nubia and Upper Egypt support this position.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Another view suggests that the decoration was carved by Nubians in imitation of Egyptian art and rituals. In this perspective, A-Group Nubian rulers would have emulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs, whose prestige and power were evident.<sup>[2]</sup></span></span></p>\n<p>The A-Group culture came to an end around 3100 BC, when it was destroyed by the First Dynasty rulers of Egypt.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3 id=2> C-Group culture</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The A-Group culture was followed later by the C-Group culture (2200-1500 BCE). Settlements consisted of round structures with stone floors. The C-Group culture had roots in sub-saharan African culture: </p>\n<p><span><span><span>Small circular houses with stone foundations, handmade ceramics with elaborate incised decoration, and graves covered with circular stone mounds are features that C-Group shared with earlier Nubian A-Group and Pre-Kerma cultures. But the importance of cattle in the C-Group, shown in its burial stelae, pottery, figurines, and rock drawings, also links it firmly to the African cattle cultures that began in the Neolithic and then spread across sub-Saharan Africa.<sup>[5]</sup></span></span></span>\n<br/></p>\n<p>The C-Group culture also had deep ties with Egypt:</p>\n<p><span><span><span> C-Group cemeteries are found as far north as Hierakonpolis in southern Egypt, and Egyptians traveled and traded in Nubia. Many Nubians were soldiers in Egyptian armies. Nubian troops featured prominently in warfare during Egypt’s First Intermediate Period (about 2100 BC), a time of civil unrest. Egyptian traders and returning Nubian soldiers brought Egyptian goods including amulets, pots, and valuable gold and silver necklaces to Nubia. Though first ruled by Egypt and then by Kerma, C-Group culture retained its own distinctive customs for centuries. Later, C-Group traditions became less visible in archaeological remains as Nubians adopted Egyptian styles during the Egyptian New Kingdom occupation of Nubia (1550–1069 BC).<sup>[5]</sup></span></span></span></p>\n<p>The C-Group culture was related to the later Kerma Culture. Archeologists uncovered several ancient constructions dating back to the pre-Kerma period (4th millennium BC- 2600 BC).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<br/>\n<h3 id=3> Kerma culture</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>Kerma (also known as Dukki Gel) was the capital city of the Kerma culture in present-day Sudan. Kerma was settled around 2500 BCE. It was a walled city containing a religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, bronze forges, and well laid out roads. Kerma was built around a large adobe temple known as the  Deffufa, a mud brick temple where ceremonies were performed on top.<sup>[4]</sup> </p>\n<p><span><span><span>Kerma has been excavated by a Swiss team for more than 30 years. The team has discovered the remains of temples, cemeteries and a city wall with bastions. Their discoveries reveal that the city was a center for trade with gold, ivory and cattle among other commodities being traded by Kerma's inhabitants. The exact amount of territory that Kerma controlled is uncertain, but it appears to have encompassed part of what is now Sudan and southern Egypt.<sup>[9]</sup></span></span></span></p>\n<p>Between 1500-1085 BCE, Egyptian conquest and domination of Nubia was achieved. This conquest brought about the Napatan Phase of Nubian history.</p>\n<p>Napata was founded by Egyptian pharaoh<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III\">Thutmose III</a> in the 15th century BC after his conquest of Nubia. The nearby Jebel Barkal was taken to mark the southern border of the New Kingdom of Egypt.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3 id=4> Twenty-fifth Dynasty</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>In 1075 BCE fragmentation of power in Egypt allowed the Nubians to regain autonomy. They founded the Kingdom of Kush, which was centered at Napata, and eventually conquered Egypt in 750 BC. They constitute the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt\">Twenty-fifth Dynasty</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho#Aegyptiaca\">Manetho’s Aegyptiaca</a>. The Twenty-fifth Dynasty ruled for a little more than one hundred years.</p>\n<p>The 25th Dynasty's reunification of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Kush created the largest Egyptian empire since the New Kingdom and ushered in a renaissance restoring traditional Egyptian values, culture, art, and architecture. </p>\n<p><span><span><span>...the 25th Dynasty \"Negro\" kings are now recognized as having sponsored an important renaissance of Egyptian art and culture; they developed an almost scholarly interest in ancient Egyptian traditions and language and have been called \"the first Egyptologists.\" The empire over which they presided was greater in extent than any ever achieved in antiquity along the Nile Valley. Their kings were said never to have condemned prisoners to death; they forgave their enemies and allowed them to retain their offices; they also actually gave public credit for achievement in their inscriptions to individuals other than themselves. Such characteristics among other ancient monarchs of Egypt or the Near East are unheard of, and we can only assume these were native Nubian qualities.<sup>[6]</sup></span></span></span></p>\n<p>The Pharos of the 25th dynasty assimilated into society by reaffirming Ancient Egyptian religious traditions, temples, and artistic forms, while introducing some unique aspects of Kushite culture.</p>\n<p>Piye, the first Pharaoh of the 25th dynasty, revived pyramid construction. He constructed the oldest known pyramid at the royal burial site of El-Kurru and expanded the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal.</p>\n<p><span><span><span>Piye was certainly remembered not as a conquering overlord, but as a just and great ancestor: He was later deified, with examples such as “Piankhi-yerike-qa” – “Begotten of the deified Piankhi” (Macadam, 1949, p.73). Posterity remembered him well as a holy king who ruled by the will of Amun. He commenced extensive building work at the temple of Amun at Gebel Barkal, and Grimal (1995, p.340) theorizes that to the Kushites, “The Gebel Barkal temple was therefore a replica of the temple of Amun in Karnak” and notes how each king after Piye enlarged upon it, in much the same way had been done at Karnak. Perhaps his work  there was a deliberate attempt to start this trend, or was simply an expression of the power and resources that had been given to him by his god. Piye’s stele is certainly not an isolated example of Amun “fundamentalism”, but is a part of a wider context in which Piye can be seen to be attempting to recreate a time of prosperity and devotion to the god that he worshipped. Myśliwiec (2000, p.84) notes “the perfection with which stress is apportioned and appropriate proportions are maintained with regard to its political and religious aspects”, in a “carefully thought-out and didactic manner”. This should demonstrate to us how the stele was a carefully planned way to present Piye in the way that he wanted to be remembered – not as a master political lord, but primarily as a worshipper of Amun. <sup>[7]</sup></span></span></span></p>\n<p>Shabaka restored the great Egyptian monuments and returned Egypt to a theocratic monarchy by becoming the first priest of Amon. In addition, Shabaka is known for creating a well-preserved example of Memphite theology by inscribing an old religious papyrus into the Shabaka Stone. </p>\n<p>Taharqa ruled as Pharaoh from Memphis, but constructed great works throughout the Nile Valley, including works at Jebel Barkal, Kawa, and Karnak.<sup>[8]</sup> At Karnak, the Sacred Lake structures, the kiosk in the first court, and the colonnades at the temple entrance are all owed to Taharqa and Mentuemhet. Taharqa built the largest pyramid in the Nubian region at Nuri (near El-Kurru).</p>\n<p>The Twenty-fifth Dynasty ruled for a little more than one hundred years. The successors of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty settled back in their Nubian homeland, where they established a kingdom at Napata (656–590 BC), then, later, at Meroë (590 BC – 4th century AD).</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"de1b649e-834f-55c4-866e-3b9cd53c98cd","frontmatter":{"country":"Somalia","title":"Land of Punt","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"punt-land"},"excerpt":"The Land of Punt (Egyptian: pwnt; alternate Egyptological readings Pwene(t)) was an ancient kingdom.

During the reign of Queen Hatshepsut in the 15th century BC, ships regularly crossed the Red Sea in order to obtain bitumen, copper, carved amulets, naptha and other goods transported overland and down the Dead Sea to Elat at the head of the gulf of Aqaba where they were joined with frankincense and myrrh coming north both by sea and overland along trade routes through the mountains running north along the east coast of the Red Sea.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"58eca628-ab61-5f41-a98a-1fea5876f32d","frontmatter":{"country":"Eritrea","title":"Dʿmt","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"dmt-ea"},"excerpt":"","timeToRead":1,"html":"<br/>\n<div>\n    <ul><ul>\n        <li>\n            Dʿmt was a kingdom located in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia that existed during the 10th to 5th centuries BC.

In its existing form the Kebra Nagast is at least 700 years old and is considered by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church\">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> to be a reliable and historic work.\n<br/><br/>\nTradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Sheba\">Queen of Sheba</a>.\n</li>\n<li>\nAround 330 AD, Ezana of Axum led his army into the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush\">Kingdom of Meroë</a>, conquering and sacking the town itself.

While there is evidence of churches being burned and an invasion around this time, her existence has been questioned by some modern authors. Another possibility is that the Aksumite power was ended by a southern pagan queen named Bani al-Hamwiyah, possibly of the tribe al-Damutah or Damoti (Sidama).

The largest known collection, found at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasr_Ibrim\">Qasr Ibrim</a>, does contain some valuable governmental records.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        At the time of the foundation of Dongola contacts were maintained with the Byzantine Empire. In the 530s, the Byzantines under Emperor Justinian mounted a policy of expansion. The Nubians were part of his plan to win allies against the Sasanian Persians by converting them to the Byzantine state religion. Archaeological records might suggest that Makuria converted in the first half of the 6th century.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        In the 7th century Egypt was conquered by the Islamic armies. Makuria was one of the few states in the world to repulse Muslim conquests led by the Rashidun Caliphate when they defeated an Arab army at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Dongola\">First Battle of Dongola</a> in 642. The Arabs had taken Egypt in 641, and the jihad soon turned south. Makuria repeated the feat in 652 at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Dongola\">Second Battle of Dongola</a>. Arab writers noted the Makurians' skill as archers in both battles. One of the few major defeats suffered by an Arab army in the first century of Islamic expansion, it led to an unprecedented agreement: the bakt. This treaty guaranteed peaceful relations between the two sides. The Nubians agreed to give Arab traders more privileges of trade in addition to a share in their slave trading, while the Egyptians may have been obliged to send manufactured goods south.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nMakuria expanded by annexing its northern neighbor Nobatia, a process which would have occurred at some point after the Sasanian conquest of Egypt, but was completed until the reign of King Merkurios. It also maintained close dynastic ties with the kingdom of Alodia to the south. The period from the 9th to 11th century saw the peak of Makuria's cultural development: new monumental buildings were erected, arts like wall paintings and finely crafted and decorated pottery flourished and Nubian grew to become the prevalent written language.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nOne of the most important discoveries of the rushed work prior to the flooding of Lower Nubia was the Cathedral of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faras\">Faras</a>. This large building had been completely filled with sand preserving a series of magnificent paintings. Similar, but less well preserved, paintings have been found at several other sites in Makuria, including palaces and private homes, giving an overall impression of Makurian art. The style and content was heavily influenced by Byzantine art, and also showed influence from Egyptian Coptic art and from Palestine. Mainly religious in nature, it depicts many of the standard Christian scenes. Also illustrated are a number of Makurian kings and bishops, with noticeably darker skin than the Biblical figures.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nWomen enjoyed a high social standing. The matrilineal succession gave the queen mother and the sister of the current king as forthcoming queen mother great political relevance. Women had access to education and there is evidence that, like in Byzantine Egypt, female scribes existed. Private land tenure was open to both men and women, meaning that both could own, buy and sell land. Transfers of land from mother to daughter were common. \n        </li>\n        <li>\nThe main economic activity in Makuria was agriculture, with farmers growing several crops a year of barley, millet, and dates. One important technological advance was the saqiya, an oxen-powered water wheel, that was introduced in the Roman period and helped increase yields and population density. Settlement patterns indicate that land was divided into individual plots rather than as in a manorial system. The peasants lived in small villages composed of clustered houses of sun-dried brick.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nImportant industries included the production of pottery, based at Faras, and weaving based at Dongola. Smaller local industries include leatherworking, metalworking, and the widespread production of baskets, mats, and sandals from palm fibre. Also important was the gold mined in the Red Sea Hills to the east of Makuria. Cattle was of great economic importance. \n        </li>\n        <li>\nIncreased aggression from Egypt, internal discord, bedouin incursions and possibly the plague and the shift of trade routes led to the state's decline in the 13th and 14th century. Due to a civil war in 1365, the kingdom was reduced to a rump state that lost much of its southern territories, including Dongola. It had disappeared by the 1560s, when the Ottoman occupied Lower Nubia. Nubia was subsequently Islamized, while the Nubians living upstream of Al Dabbah and in Kordofan were also Arabized.\n        </li>\n    </ul></ul>\n</div>\nRead more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria"}},{"node":{"id":"c9e04f5b-583c-5d36-bc47-45d11fcdb42a","frontmatter":{"country":"Sudan","title":"Kingdom of Nobatia","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"nobatia_kgdm"},"excerpt":"Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia","timeToRead":3,"html":"<br/>\n<div>\n    <ul><ul>\n        <li>\n            Nobatia was a late antique kingdom in Lower Nubia.

The Nobatae had been invited into the region from the Western Desert by the Roman Emperor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian\">Diocletian</a> in 297 AD.

Around this time the Nobatian capital was established at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faras\">Pakhoras</a> (modern Faras); soon after, Nobatia converted to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodoxy\">non-Chalcedonian Christianity</a>.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            By 707, Nobatia had been annexed to its southern neighbor, Makuria. The merger most likely occurred before the Muslim conquest in 652, since the Arab histories speak of only one Christian state in Nubia and reached at least as far as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dongola\">Old Dongola</a>. Nobatia seems to have maintained some autonomy in the new state. It was ruled by an eparch of Nobatia who was also titled the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestikos\">Domestikos</a> of Pakhoras. These were originally appointed but seem to be dynastic in the later period. Some of their records have been found at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasr_Ibrim\">Fort Ibrim</a>, presenting a figure with a great deal of power. Nobatia՚s name is often given as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Maris_(region)\">al-Maris</a> in Arabic histories. The eparchate of Nobadia remained an integral part of the kingdom of Makuria until the very end, as is confirmed by a document from 1463 mentioning an eparch named Teedderre.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Archaeology from the pagan period confirms the relevance archery had for the Nubians and therefore also the Nobatians. The slightly reflexed longsbows, which are attested for Kushite mercenaries since the Middle Kingdom, were replaced by reflex composite bows during the Meroitic or post-Meroitic period, measuring around one meter and originally designed to be shot from horseback. One simple wooden self bow is known from an early Nobadian burial in Qustul. Furthermore, the archers wore thumb rings, measuring between three and four cm. Thus, Nubian archers would have employed a drawing technique very similar to the Persian and Chinese one, both of which also reliant on thumb rings.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            A weapon characteristic for the Nobadians was a type of short sword. It has a straight hollow-ground blade which was sharpened only on one edge and was therefore not designed to thrust, but to hack. Apart of said swords, there were also lances, some of them with large blades, as well as halberds.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Nobadian warriors and their leadership made use of shields and body armour, most of it manufactured from leather.\n        </li>\n    </ul></ul>\n</div>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia</a></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"c3bd136e-38e8-5459-8df6-721494e020d8","frontmatter":{"country":"Sudan","title":"Kingdom of Alodia","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"alodia-kngdm"},"excerpt":"","timeToRead":2,"html":"<br/>\n<div>\n    <ul><ul>\n        <li>\n            Alodia (6th century–c. 1500) was a medieval Nubian kingdom, founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell (around 350 AD), in what is now central and southern Sudan.

The capital Soba, described as a town of \"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n            In the mid-10th century, Alodia was visited by traveler and historian Ibn Hawqal, resulting in the most comprehensive known account of the kingdom. He described the geography and people of Alodia in considerable detail, giving the impression of a large, polyethnic state. He also noted its prosperity, having an \"uninterrupted chain of villages and a continuous strip of cultivated lands\".\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Monumental structures, have been unearthed in the capital Soba.

Coptic documents observed by Johann Michael Vansleb during the later 17th century list the following bishoprics in the Alodian kingdom: Arodias, Borra, Gargara, Martin, Banazi, and Menkesa. Arodias might have referred to the bishopric in Soba. The bishops were dependent on the patriarch of Alexandria.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Alodia may have had a standing army, in which cavalry likely projected force and symbolized royal authority deep into the provinces. Because of their speed, horses were also important for communication, providing a rapid courier service between the capital and the provinces. Aside from horses, boats also played a central role in transportation infrastructure.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Fazughli\">Kingdom of Fazughli</a> within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands.

The Neolithic site of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhar_Tichitt\">Dhar Tichitt</a> in this area was settled by agropastoral communities around 2000 BC. Their settlements were generally situated on the cliffs and included stone building.

They are thought to have been built by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soninke_people\">Soninke people</a> and were possibly the precursor of the Ghana empire. The area was abandoned around 500 BC probably because of the onset of more arid conditions. Hundreds of rock art images have been discovered, depicting various animals and hunting scenes.

Amblard have found some evidence that millet was farmed seasonally as early as 2000 BC.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Complex societies based on trans-Saharan trade with salt and gold had existed in the region since ancient times. There is evidence that North Africa had begun importing gold from West Africa before the Arab conquest in the middle of the seventh century. The earliest author to mention Ghana is the Persian astronomer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibr%C4%81h%C4%ABm_al-Faz%C4%81r%C4%AB\">Ibrahim al-Fazari</a> who, writing at the end of the eighth century, refers to \"the territory of Ghana, the land of gold\".

The discovery in 1913 of a 17th-century African chronicle that gave the name of the capital as Koumbi led French archaeologists to the ruins at Koumbi Saleh. Excavations at the site have revealed the ruins of a large Muslim town with houses built of stone and a congregational mosque but no inscription to unambiguously identify the site as that of capital of Ghana. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the site was occupied between the late 9th and 14th centuries.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Most of the information about the economy of Ghana comes from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Bakri\">Al-Bakri</a>. Al-Bakri noted that merchants had to pay a one gold dinar tax on imports of salt, and two on exports of salt. Other products paid fixed dues, al-Bakri mentioned both copper and \"other goods.\" Imports probably included products such as textiles, ornaments and other materials. Many of the hand-crafted leather goods found in old Morocco also had their origins in the empire. The main centre of trade was Koumbi Saleh. The king claimed as his own all nuggets of gold, and allowed other people to have only gold dust. In addition to the exerted influence of the king onto local regions, tribute was also received from various tributary states and chiefdoms to the empire's periphery.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            In the 11th century the Cordoban scholar Abuof travelled to the region and gave a detailed description of the kingdom.

His grandson Gijimasu (1095–1134), the third king, began building city walls at the foot of Dalla Hill, and Gijimasu's son, Tsaraki (1136–1194), the fifth king, completed them during his reign. The Bagauda family steadily extended the kingdom through conquest of nearby communities.

Biram was the original seat of government, while Zaria supplied labor and was known as the \"Chief of Slaves.\" Katsina and Daura were the \"Chiefs of the Market,\" as their geographical location accorded them direct access to the caravans coming across the desert from the north.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, it began to develop as an empire following the decline of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Empire\">Ghana Empire</a> to the north.

It contained three immense gold mines within its borders. The empire taxed gold, copper and salt that entered its borders. By the beginning of the 14th century, Mali was the source of almost half the Old World's gold exported from mines in Bambuk, Boure and Galam.

Mali flourished especially when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu\">Timbuktu</a> came under Mansa Musa’s control. Timbuktu was a place of trade, entertainment, and education.

The entire nation was mobilised, with each clan obligated to provide a quota of fighting-age men. Historians who lived during the height and decline of the Mali Empire consistently record its army at 100,000, with 10,000 of that number being made up of cavalry. Swords and lances of local or foreign manufacture were the choice weapons of the cavalry. Spears and bows were the mainstay of the infantry. Bowmen formed a large portion of the field army as well as the garrison. Equipped with two quivers and a knife fastened to the back of their arm, Mandinka bowmen used barbed, iron-tipped arrows that were usually poisoned. They also used flaming arrows for siege warfare. Numerous sources attest that the inland waterways of West Africa saw extensive use of war canoes and vessels used for war transport where permitted by the environment.

Occupational castes included blacksmiths, jewellers, tanners, tailors, musicians and griots.

Griots (storytellers) were employed by every important family as chroniclers and advisors, without whom much of early Jolof history would be unknown.

They kept animals such as sheep, goats, cattle and chickens; those with many livestock were considered rich and were accorded very high economic status within the society. \n        </li>\n        <li>\nTrade was another important economic activity and the Rozvi practiced both internal and external trade. From foreign traders they obtained imported goods such as guns, salt, beads and sea shells; in return they bartered ivory, copper and gold. Mining was another major branch and was done by males. \n        </li>\n        <li>\nIts warriors were known to be violent; this earned them the name rozvi, meaning plunders or destroyers. They became the most powerful fighting force in the whole of Zimbabwe.\n        </li>\n        <li>\nRecords from the Portuguese show that the Rozvi were sophisticated military strategists. They were noted for using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka#The_%22bull_horn%22_formation\">cow-horn formation</a> years before the great Zulu leader Shaka adopted it in the 19th century.

Osei Tutu oversaw a massive Ashanti territorial expansion, building up the army by introducing new organisation and turning a disciplined royal and paramilitary army into an effective fighting machine.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            The Ashanti armies served the empire well, supporting its long period of expansion and subsequent resistance to European colonization. Armament was primarily with firearms, but some historians hold that indigenous organization and leadership probably played a more crucial role in Ashanti successes.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            The Ashanti government was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries to handle the state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi;. It allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Before the Ashanti Kingdom had contact with Europeans, it had a flourishing trade with other African states due to the Ashanti gold wealth. Trade with European states began after contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century AD. When the gold mines in the Sahel started to play out, the Ashanti Kingdom rose to prominence as the major player in the gold trade. At the height of the Ashanti Kingdom, the Ashanti people became wealthy through the trading of gold mined from their territory.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            In 1701, the Ashanti army conquered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkyira\">Denkyira</a>, giving the Ashanti access to the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean coastal trade with Europeans, notably the Dutch.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            The original palace of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Asante\">Asantehene</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi\">Kumasi</a>, from European accounts, was massive and ornately built. The current residence of the Asantehene is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhyia_Palace\">Manhyia Palace</a> built in 1925 by the British and presented to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prempeh_I\">Prempeh I</a> as a present upon his return from exile. The original palace of the Asantehene in Kumasi was burned down by the British in 1875. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n            The Ashanti invented the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontomfrom\">Fontomfrom</a>, an Asante <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_drum\">talking drum</a>, and they also invented the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akan_Drum\">Akan Drum</a>. They drummed messages to distances of over 300 kilometres (200 mi), as rapidly as a telegraph. Asante dialect (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twi\">Twi</a>) and Akan, the language of the Ashanti people is tonal and more meaning is generated by tone. The drums reproduced these tones, punctuations, and the accents of a phrase so that the cultivated ear hears the entirety of the phrase itself.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Slavery was historically a tradition in the Ashanti Empire, with slaves typically taken as captives from enemies in warfare. The welfare of their slaves varied from being able to acquire wealth and intermarry with the master's family to being sacrificed in funeral ceremonies. The Ashanti believed that slaves would follow their masters into the afterlife. Slaves could sometimes own other slaves, and could also request a new master if the slave believed he or she was being severely mistreated.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            Today, the Ashanti Kingdom survives as a constitutionally protected, sub-national proto-state and traditional state in union with the Republic of Ghana.\n        </li>\n    </ul></ul>\n</div>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire</a></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"3fc22009-8b5a-55b3-a4f8-1ae7d4cac64c","frontmatter":{"country":"SouthAfrica","title":"Kingdom of Zululand","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"zululand"},"excerpt":"","timeToRead":1,"html":"<br/>\n<div>\n    <ul><ul>\n        <li>\nThe Kingdom of Zulu , sometimes referred to as the Zulu Empire or the Kingdom of Zululand, was a monarchy in Southern Africa that extended along the coast of the Indian Ocean from the Tugela River in the south to Pongola River in the north.\n         </li>\n        <li>\nThe kingdom grew to dominate much of what is today <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal\">KwaZulu-Natal</a> and Southern Africa. \n         </li>\n        <li>\nShaka kaSenzangakhona (c. 1787 – 1828), also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka\">Shaka</a> Zulu (also spelled Tshaka or Chaka), was one of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu Kingdom.
