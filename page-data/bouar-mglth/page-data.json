Hundreds of them are to be found in the borderland between Cameroon and Central African Republic. They are thought to be memorials, but contain no human remains, and were made by cultivators during the first millennium BCE. That they had the energy and resources to cut, transport and erect stones so large that they posed a danger to modern excavators shows the strength the religious or other beliefs which inspired them. It also reflects a culture which could afford this type of extravagance” - Elizabeth Allo Isichei – 1997.
